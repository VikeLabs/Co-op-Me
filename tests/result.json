In the INSPIRE program, many students have developed solutions with direct, significant impact in our communities. You can also become a member of our Apprentice Garage Program, where you develop solutions with a direct community partner and impact their business and lives! The INSPIRE program will also support you to connect and engage with industry mentors, as well as to be part of a diverse and inclusive learning environment at the University of Victoria. Our Apprentice Garage program offers a unique 4-month work-integrated learning opportunity for students to ideate, design, prototype, and implement solutions that have a profound societal impact. We strongly encourage applications from students from underrepresented groups in STEM, including individuals of marginalized genders, Indigenous peoples, members of racialized minorities, people with disabilities, and LGBTQ2S+ individuals. Participants will receive training in EDI and various development methodologies, including IBM's Enterprise Design Thinking.\n\nProject Description\nThe upcoming project, \"BrightPath Supporting Neurodiversity in Learning,\" is an innovative four-month initiative where you will work in a team to develop a BrightSpace plugin. This plugin aims to enhance the educational experience for neurodiverse students by providing customized learning tools and resources directly within the BrightSpace environment. The project will include ideation, design, prototyping, and implementation phases, with a strong focus on accessibility and user-centered design.\n\nInternship Details\nThis Apprentice Garage internship is a stepping stone to creating meaningful connections within the community and with industry partners, enhancing your confidence through practical experience, and fostering a sense of belonging. As an intern, you will commit to a 4-month period from September to December, requiring full time, in-person participation. This role is exclusive, making you ineligible for other co-ops during the period. Participants can enroll in an additional course during the Fall, provided they maintain a minimum GPA of 7.8 and commit to full-time co-op hours (37 hours per week). The position offers a stipend in the range of $11,500 for the term (details will be provided in the interview).\n\nIf you are inspired to make a difference and ready to challenge yourself in a dynamic team environment, we encourage you to apply for this transformative project.
