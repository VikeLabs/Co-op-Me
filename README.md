### Development and Contribution

We are utilizing Next.js for routing and React as the front-end library, along with TypeScript for static type-checking. On the back-end, we are using MySQL as the database management system along with Prisma as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool to interact with the database. Additionally, we are incorporating shadcn-ui, more about that below!

We're at an early stage of development for this project, and we're actively seeking developers to join our team. If you're interested contributing and developing this application, please feel free to leave a message in the _Team-Formation/project-formation_ in the **VikeLabs' Discord Server**, or contact the developers for this project.

### Shadcn UI

Shadcn is a collection of pre-built UI components that offer a quick and easy way to build user interfaces.  Unlike some libraries, you don't need to install everything; just pick the components you need and integrate them directly into your project.  Shadcn prioritizes customization and accessibility, so you can tailor components to your design and ensure everyone can use them. It's also open-source, so feel free to use and contribute to the code!
